# Bank of Ireland Graph Tool

## Description
This is a repo for a tool that creates graphs based on Bank of Ireland (BOI) exported data.
The end goal is the create a desktop application that displays their income and expenditure in a way that's easier to consume.
The reasoning behind a desktop application is I know I'd feel safer being able to block it via firewall, and I can't afford to host this project online.

_My work has no direct affiliation with BOI._

## To-Do List
- [x] Write readme.md (gotta start somewhere)
